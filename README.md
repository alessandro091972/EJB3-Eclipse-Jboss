Simple EJB3 stateless ECLIPSE JBOSS

EJB 3 stateless and a Java application client which will invoke the bean in wildfly(Jboss) application server.

For testing example I wrote a remote Java Application Client with main() method.

For simpleness, the Ejb and the client are created in the same project.



Environment Used:

JDK 8 (Java SE 8)

EJB 3.0 (stateless session bean)

Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers. Version: Mars.1 Release (4.5.1)

JBoss Tools â€“ Core 3.3.0 M5 for Eclipse

Wildfly-9.0.2.Final
